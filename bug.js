This React Native bug manifests when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data.  The issue arises when attempting to retrieve data that doesn't exist.  Instead of receiving a null or undefined value, the app crashes with an error similar to: "undefined is not an object (evaluating 'item.someProperty')". This usually occurs because the app tries to access a property on a null or undefined object retrieved from AsyncStorage.
